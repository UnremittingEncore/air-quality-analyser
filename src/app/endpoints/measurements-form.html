            Reduce the intensity of your outdoor activities. Keep relevant medication(s) available and consult a doctor with any questions. It is recommended to limit the time you are near busy roads, construction sites, open fires and other sources of smoke. In addition, consider reducing the time you spend near industrial emission stacks. Staying indoors with an activated air filtration system would be best for your long term health.
